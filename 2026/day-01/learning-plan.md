# 90 Days of DevOps – Personal Learning Plan

## Current Level

I am a **working professional** with ~3.5 years of experience in IT/DevOps. I have hands-on exposure to basic DevOps concepts and tools, but my knowledge is fragmented. My goal is to strengthen fundamentals, gain production-level confidence, and become interview- and job-ready for a strong DevOps/Cloud role.

## My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud

DevOps is the practice of **building, deploying, monitoring, and improving software reliably and continuously** through automation, collaboration, and ownership. Cloud enables DevOps by providing scalable infrastructure, managed services, and pay-as-you-go resources that support fast experimentation and resilient systems.

## Why I’m Learning DevOps & Cloud (Now)

* To move from **tool-level knowledge to system-level thinking**
* To confidently design, deploy, and troubleshoot real-world production systems
* To grow into a DevOps engineer who can take ownership, not just execute tasks

## Where I Want to Reach (90-Day Vision)

By the end of 90 days, I want to be confident enough to:

* Design and deploy a **production-grade application on AWS using Docker & Kubernetes**
* Build **end-to-end CI/CD pipelines** with security and monitoring
* Clear **mid-level DevOps interviews** with strong fundamentals and real project explanations

## 3 Clear Goals (Next 90 Days)

1. Deploy a complete 3-tier application on **AWS + Kubernetes** with monitoring and alerts
2. Build and document **2 real-world DevOps projects** (CI/CD + Infra + Monitoring)
3. Become interview-ready across **Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, CI/CD, and Monitoring**

## 3 Core DevOps Skills to Build

* **Linux & System Troubleshooting** (logs, processes, networking, performance)
* **CI/CD & Automation** (Jenkins, Git, pipelines, secrets, deployments)
* **Kubernetes & Cloud Debugging** (pods, services, ingress, scaling, failures)

## Weekly Time Commitment

* **Weekdays:** 2–2.5 hours/day (learning + hands-on)
* **Weekends:** 4–6 hours/day (projects, revision, documentation)
* **Total:** ~18–20 hours/week

## Consistency & Discipline Plan

* Study **daily at a fixed time**, no zero days
* Focus on **hands-on first, theory second**
* Maintain GitHub commits and LinkedIn learning-in-public posts
* Weekly self-review: what I learned, what broke, what improved

## Personal Rule

> Consistency over perfection. Show up every day, even on low-energy days.

---

**Commitment:** I will execute this plan honestly for the next 90 days and take full ownership of my growth as a DevOps engineer.
